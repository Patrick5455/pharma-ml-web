    <h1>Pharmaceutical Sales prediction across
        multiple stores</h1>

    <h3>Business Need</h3>

    <p>We work at Rossmann Pharmaceuticals  as a data scientist. The finance team wants to
forecast sales in all their stores across several cities six weeks ahead of time. Managers in
individual stores rely on their years of experience as well as their personal judgement to
forecast sales.</p>

        <p>The data team identified factors such as promotions, competition, school and state holidays,
            seasonality, and locality as necessary for predicting the sales across the various stores.</p>

 <p> Our job is to build and serve an end-to-end product that delivers this prediction to Analysts
in the finance team.</p>

     <h3>Tasks</h3>

     <ul>
         <li> <h4>Exploration of customer purchasing
             behavior:</h4>
         <p>Exploratory data analysis is the lifeblood of every meaningful machine learning project. It
helps us unravel the nature of the data and sometimes informs how we go about modelling.
A careful exploration of the data encapsulates checking all available features, checking
their interactions and correlation as well as their variability with respect to the target.
In this task, we seek to explore the behaviour of customers in the various stores. Our goal is
to check how some measures such as promos and opening of new stores affect purchasing
behavior.
To achieve this goal, we need to first clean the data. The data cleaning process will involve
building pipelines to detect and handle outlier and missing data. This is particularly
important because we donâ€™t want to skew our analysis.
Visualizing various features and interactions is necessary for clearly communicating our
findings.</p>

             <h4>Prediction of store sales</h4>

             <p>Prediction of sales is the central task in this challenge. We want to predict daily sales in
various stores up to 6 weeks ahead of time. This will help the company plan ahead of time.</p>
         </li>

         <li>
             <h4>Serving predictions on a web interface</h4>
             <P>We would be building a basic web app to automatically do everything from
modelling to serving predictions. Your task is to build a solution at scale using the steps
outlined below:</P>
